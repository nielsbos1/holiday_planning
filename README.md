4. **Mobile Friendly**: Access your holiday plan on any device
5. **Use Scenarios**: Create multiple scenarios to compare different holiday strategies:
   - **Conservative Plan**: Minimal holidays for emergencies
   - **Optimal Plan**: Best use of bridge days and long weekends
   - **Dream Plan**: All desired holidays without budget constraints
6. **Company Holidays**: Add company-specific days like team events or office closures
7. **Scenario Naming**: Use descriptive names like "Summer Focus" or "Christmas Heavy"
8. **Half-Day Strategy**: Use half days for:
   - **Medical appointments** during work hours
   - **School events** or parent meetings
   - **Flexible Friday afternoons** in summer
   - **Bridge day optimization** (half day + weekend = long break)
   - **Gradual return** from long vacations

## Troubleshooting üîß

A: Use the "Clear All" button in the Actions section

**Q: Can I use this for other years?**

A: Scenarios are stored in browser localStorage. Use "Export All" to create file backups that persist even after clearing browser data

**Q: Can I use my scenarios on a different computer?**
A: Yes! Export your scenarios to a JSON file, then import them on any other device/browser

**Q: What happens when I import scenarios with the same names?**
